# Changelog

What changes from release to release, for the people who run Lalabase. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

**Versions are dates:** `YEAR.MONTH.PATCH`, the month without a leading zero
(`2026.11.0`, `2027.1.0`). A release usually comes once a month; a second one in the
same month, typically a security fix, counts up the last number (`2026.11.1`).

**`main` is what our hosted service runs. To run your own instance, install a release**
(a tag), not `main`.

Every release has **Upgrade notes**: what you have to do when you update (a new
environment variable, a task that runs once, a new system dependency). Read them before
you update. Migrations and the data backfills run by themselves when the container
starts (`db:prepare lalabase:data_backfills`). Without Docker, run
`bin/rails db:migrate lalabase:data_backfills` after each update.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Synced documentation pages show their images from your instance. The sync copies them
  out of the repository, and they are served behind the right to read the documentation,
  so a reader no longer contacts the repository host and images from private repositories
  show. An image that cannot be served shows as its alt text, one with a full address
  becomes a link. SVG is not shown yet. Limits: 5 MB per image, 200 images per set.

### Upgrade notes

- Run `bin/rails documentation:resync_all` once after updating. Until then a page keeps
  its old image addresses, unless its repository receives a new commit.

## [2026.11.0] - 2026-10-31

<!-- drafted from d31c38282b6a52e09e33ebbe4195546d11421234 -->

### Added

- A Docker image for each release, `ghcr.io/lalabase/lalabase:<version>`, for linux/amd64
  and linux/arm64. It boots and passes the install check before it is pushed, and carries a
  signed record of where it was built (`gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/lalabase/lalabase:<version> --owner lalabase`).
  `compose.yml` of a release pulls the image of that release instead of building it, and
  `compose.build.yml` still builds the image from the checkout (#48).
- A people directory for each organisation: members appear on their own, contacts without a
  login are added by hand, with a salutation and up to ten labelled details (a second phone, a
  website, an address). A person shows their last contact and their meetings, and a meeting
  participant can point to a person. Two new role rights decide who may see and who may keep the
  list, see the upgrade notes (#50), (#51), (#54), (#59), (#61), (#64), (#65), (#70), (#74).
- The assistant looks people up in the directory, and the directory can be read over MCP and
  `/api/v1`, by the same rights (#73), (#77).
- A member chooses which email the others see: the login address (the default, as before), a
  separate contact address, or none, under **Profile** (#82), (#88).
- A meeting can move to another project, with its booked time, under the new role right
  `move_meetings` (#45).
- A meeting linked to a ticket opens beside the ticket in a read-only panel that fits the
  width of the page, and the assistant is offered both (#40), (#42), (#43).
- Search hits show their date, and their labels are translated (#66).
- MCP server 0.15 with 19 tools, five more than 2026.10.1. `list_organisations` and
  `list_projects`: an agent now finds the ids the other tools ask for itself, instead of taking
  them from the address bar. `summarize_time_sessions`, and `find_people` and `get_person` for
  the directory. `get_ticket` lists the files of a comment (#71), (#77), (#89), (#90), (#93), (#94), (#95).
- `/api/v1` is now fit for programs (API 1.8.0, the Lalabase CLI uses it): an error `code` next
  to `error`, an `Idempotency-Key` on every write, `api_version` and `capabilities` in
  `GET /api/v1/me`, the ticket view with pages and by number, time booking, plain text comments,
  a project's knowledge, `POST /api/v1/tickets/:id/changes`, and the files of a comment
  (#72), (#76), (#78), (#81), (#83), (#85), (#87), (#89).

### Changed

- The page with name, login address and password is now called **Account**, and the page with
  the picture, the shown email and the name spelling **Profile** (#86).

### Fixed

- AI answers no longer run short because the model spent its output limit on thinking
  (Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI reasoning models). An answer cut off at the limit is an error for
  meeting summaries and analyses, not a result (#49).
- Building the image yourself no longer fails on the first `up --build` with Docker 29:
  only the web service builds, and the worker runs the image it built (#48).
- An MCP write with an `idempotency_key` that cannot be stored is refused before it writes.
  It used to write, fail, and write again on every retry (#84).
- `bundle install` works on Ubuntu 26.04, for installs without Docker (#41).

### Security

- The rate limit of `/api/v1` and `/api/mcp` no longer writes access tokens in plain text
  into the cache. It counts per digest of the token. With the default file cache, tokens
  that were in use stood in file names under `tmp/cache` (#92).
- An email a member keeps from the others is held back everywhere: pages, search, the
  assistant, MCP and `/api/v1`. Activities no longer store login addresses, and the addresses
  they stored, with their copies in notifications and outbox events, are removed when you
  update (#82).
- The meetings shown on a ticket are checked against the project each meeting is in. After a
  ticket moved to another project, its page could show titles and dates of meetings the reader
  had no rights to (#39).
- An unexpected failure while booking time or commenting over `/api/v1` no longer returns the
  text of the exception (#78), (#81).
- Backups kept in the repository directory stay out of an image you build yourself (#60).
- Updated dependencies: crass 1.0.8 for GHSA-pq4g-8rxf-4g29 (#46), ViewComponent 4.14.0 for
  GHSA-8qw7-6phv-7q6p (#47), mcp 1.8.2 for GHSA-4m5j-jjfc-97gx (#52).

### Maintenance

- Tests and CI, with no effect on a running instance (#53), (#67), (#68), (#69), (#75), (#79), (#80).
- Repository documentation: invited contributions may also be licensed under Apache-2.0, the
  README names the terminal client, and `ops/backup` says it describes our servers, not a
  self-hosting guide (#44), (#62), (#63), (#91).

### Upgrade notes

- Take a backup first. Six migrations run when the container starts, and a data backfill
  (`activities:drop_stored_emails`) removes stored login addresses for good. Both run by
  themselves; without Docker, run `bin/rails db:migrate lalabase:data_backfills` as usual. The
  backfill reads the activities, notifications and outbox events at each start.
- `compose.yml` no longer builds the image: it pulls `ghcr.io/lalabase/lalabase` in the
  version of the release you checked out. Update with `git fetch --tags && git checkout 2026.11.0`,
  then `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`. If you changed your `compose.yml`,
  compare it with this one first.
- To keep building the image on your server, add `COMPOSE_FILE=compose.yml:compose.build.yml`
  to `.env`, and update with `docker compose up -d --build`, now and for later releases.
  In this setup `docker compose pull` stops with an error, and `docker compose up -d`
  without `--build` goes on running the old image and says nothing.
- Leave `LALABASE_VERSION` out of `.env`. Set, it pins the image, and a release checked out
  later keeps running the pinned version.
- Unless you keep building the image, the image `lalabase:local` that earlier releases built
  is no longer used: `docker image rm lalabase:local` removes it.
- Access tokens in `tmp/cache` (#92). With Docker the directory lives in the container and
  goes when the update replaces it, unless you mounted a volume there. Otherwise empty its
  contents once after updating. If that directory is part of a backup, or someone you do not
  trust could read it, replace your access tokens.
- No existing role gets the new rights `view_people`, `manage_people` and `move_meetings`.
  Account admins need none of them; for everyone else, grant them in the roles of the
  organisation.
- The members page now shows only the email a member chose, to organisation admins as well.
  The login address stays visible in the instance admin area. For API and MCP clients, the
  `email` of a member can be the contact address or `null`.
- API clients: an unexpected failure of `POST /api/v1/tickets/:ticket_id/time_sessions` or
  `POST /api/v1/tickets/:ticket_id/posts` now answers 500 instead of 422. A write on `/api/v1`
  with an `Idempotency-Key` over 255 bytes is refused with 422.
- No new required environment variables. `LALABASE_VERSION` and `COMPOSE_FILE` are optional,
  see above.

## [2026.10.1] - 2026-10-21

<!-- drafted from d03168b613c25580924a59815580a512c0b95666 -->

### Added

- "Alle Meetings" works like the meetings page of a project: the shared filter bar with saved
  views and search, a filter by project, the column picker, and the detail lane on the right
  for opening a meeting or creating a new one with a project select (#5, #7, #8, #11).
- `bin/rails rich_text_embeds:resign_sgids` brings back the images and note mentions of rich
  texts after a new `SECRET_KEY_BASE` (run it with `DRY_RUN=1` first). It needs no old key.
  See "Moving to a new server or cloning a server" in the self-hosting docs (#23, #24, #25).
- A demo mode for a public demo instance, behind `LALABASE_DEMO=1`: a shared, published
  login, an invented example company, a reset every night, limits on uploads and AI requests.
  The nightly reset deletes all data of the instance. Do not set `LALABASE_DEMO` on a normal
  instance; without it nothing changes (#18, #21, #26, #28, #30, #33).

### Changed

- The API list of a ticket's files (`GET /api/v1/tickets/:id/attachments`) loads them in one
  query. The files of comments now come in the order of the comments' ids (#1).

### Fixed

- Images in rich texts are kept when an instance gets a new `SECRET_KEY_BASE`, for example
  after moving to a new server or cloning one. Until now, editing such a text afterwards
  detached its images and deleted the files (#23).
- Escape closes only the topmost menu or dialog. Before, a filter menu or the "+" dialog
  could also close the detail lane behind it, together with an unsaved edit (#9).
- The "+" on a project's meetings page opens the new-meeting form as its own state: the
  previously open meeting is no longer marked, and a reload shows the form again (#16).
- The dates in the knowledge list follow the language of the interface (#10).

### Security

- IDs taken from a request are now always checked against the organisation: the Kanban
  attribute of a view, the user mapping of the codebase user import, the recipient of a
  private comment through the API, and the users in smart folder rules (#3).
- A custom OpenAI-compatible AI endpoint is checked by the addresses its name resolves to,
  on saving and again on every request, and only public addresses are accepted. The
  connection test no longer shows raw network errors (#20, #22).
- Cloning a connected repository writes symbolic links as plain files, so documentation
  sync and code indexing cannot read files outside the repository (#19).
- The client address behind a reverse proxy comes from `X-Forwarded-For` only. A
  `Forwarded` header sent by a client is ignored, so it can no longer change the address
  that the sign-in and other request limits count (#27).

### Upgrade notes

- If the `SECRET_KEY_BASE` of your instance was ever changed (moved to a new server, cloned
  from another one), run `bin/rails rich_text_embeds:resign_sgids` once, first with
  `DRY_RUN=1` (in Docker: `docker compose exec web bin/rails rich_text_embeds:resign_sgids`).
  It reattaches images and note mentions that show as missing.
- Behind a reverse proxy, the client address now comes from `X-Forwarded-For` only. Caddy
  (as in `compose.yml`) and nginx set it. A proxy that sends only a `Forwarded` header makes
  every visitor count as the proxy, so all of them share one request limit: configure it to
  set `X-Forwarded-For`.

## [2026.10.0] - 2026-10-12

<!-- drafted from 4622099a2ca151fbe8fa3995108ca320a2d3cbee -->

### Added

- First public release. Lalabase has been developed since October 2024 (more than 2,300 commits,
  about 970 pull requests) and has run in production for customers since September 2025. The earlier
  history stays private: it holds customer data and details of our servers.

### Upgrade notes

- None.
