    # The knowledge of one project (notes and documents) for a program such as the terminal
    # client (REST R2), read through Knowledge::Lookup like the MCP tool search_knowledge
    # (cli_rest_plan D5): the same rows, order, fields and total for the same search.
    #
    # * Without `q` REST lists every readable row, newest first, so a client can open the
    #   knowledge area without a search term. MCP keeps `q` required.
    # * Paging: a page or per_page that is no whole number from 1 to the maximum is refused
    #   with 422, where MCP clamps: a program would get fewer rows than it asked for without
    #   being told. An absent or empty value means the default; a NUL in q or type is refused.
    #   Checked before the project is looked up, so the 422 does not depend on whether the
    #   project exists.
    # * The project gate is the one of MCP (Mcp::ToolCall#authorized_project): the token's reach
    #   and the owner's access to the project. A missing project, a malformed id, a project
    #   beyond the reach, one the owner cannot open and one of another organisation answer the
    #   same 404. A reader who may open the project but read no knowledge gets an empty list.
