    # box branched on the pointer alone. They disagreed in two of these four
    # combinations, and the worst of them promised continuity to an organisation
    # whose search would be empty — and empty until the month rolled over. Enforcing
    # one rule by hand in two places is what produced that, so it is expressed once,
    # as data (#437 review, fourth round).
    #

    #   * POINTER — without active_embedding_space_id,

    #     switch). Reachable: the column is nullable and #431's ActivationBackfill is
    #     fail-soft.
    #   * QUOTA — an exhausted budget does not stop the write, it postpones the
    #     REBUILD to next month (P4d's watcher resumes it), which moves the "until
    #     then" of every one of these sentences.
