# frozen_string_literal: true

# View helpers for the organisation sidebar navigation (common/_navigation_application).
#
# Two responsibilities, both extracted here so they live in exactly ONE place:
#   1. The permission gates for the org switcher menu and the gear that opens the
#      management area (moved verbatim from the inline checks that used to sit in the
#      partial).
#   2. The SINGLE source of truth for the sections of the management area: the
#      sidebar's management list renders from #management_sections, and the section a
#      page belongs to (#management_section_key) derives from the SAME definition. No
#      mirrored array, so the two can never drift apart.
module NavigationHelper
  # Max number of organisation rows shown directly in the switcher menu. Beyond this
  # the user is sent to the full cockpit via "Alle Organisationen" (kept as a named
  # constant instead of a magic number so the boundary is testable + self-documenting).
  ORG_MENU_LIMIT = 7

  # One entry per section of the management area. `controller_name` is the RAILS
  # controller_name of the section's page (deliberately NOT the key `controller:`, which
  # the stimulus-wiring guard reads as a Stimulus mount); #management_section_key finds
  # the section of a page by it, and the section of a page below one through
  # MANAGEMENT_PAGE_SECTIONS. `label_key` / `path_helper` are resolved lazily in
  # #management_sections because both need view context (I18n + the URL helpers, which
  # take the org).
  #
  # `gate:` names an Organisation predicate that must answer true for the section to be
  # offered at all. It is data rather than an inline `if` in the renderer so a second
  # gated section needs no new branch. The gate hides the ENTRANCE only; the matching
  # policy still has to refuse the actions (CodebaseImportFilePolicy#import_permitted?).
  #
  # Since 2026-11-11 the sections are no tab row any more but the sidebar's own list while
  # the area is open (common/_navigation_management, doc/verwaltung_seitennavigation_plan.md);
  # the constant keeps the name it had as a tab row. `icon:` is the row's sign there,
  # `group:` the block it stands in (a hairline between blocks), in this order: what the
  # organisation is, what it uses, the account above it.
