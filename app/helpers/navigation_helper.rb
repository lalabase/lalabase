# View helpers for the organisation sidebar navigation (common/_navigation_application).
#
# Two responsibilities, both extracted here so they live in exactly ONE place:
#   1. The permission gates for the org switcher menu and the "Verwaltung" sidebar
#      entry (moved verbatim from the inline checks that used to sit in the partial).
#   2. The SINGLE source of truth for the organisation-management settings tabs — the
#      settings subnav renders from #organisation_settings_tabs, and the sidebar's
#      active-state (#management_section_active?) derives its controller list from the
#      SAME definition. No mirrored array, so the two can never drift apart.
module NavigationHelper
  # Max number of organisation rows shown directly in the switcher menu. Beyond this
  # the user is sent to the full cockpit via "Alle Organisationen" (kept as a named
  # constant instead of a magic number so the boundary is testable + self-documenting).
  ORG_MENU_LIMIT = 7

  # One entry per organisation-management settings tab. `controller_name` is the
  # RAILS controller_name the tab's pages render under (deliberately NOT the key
  # `controller:`, which the stimulus-wiring guard reads as a Stimulus mount);
  # `management_section_active?` uses it to keep the sidebar "Verwaltung" entry
  # highlighted across all eight tabs (plus AI_AREA_CONTROLLERS for the pages behind
  # the "KI" tab, which have no tab of their own). `label_key` / `path_helper` are resolved
  # lazily in #organisation_settings_tabs because both need view context (I18n +
  # the URL helpers, which take the org).
  #
  # `gate:` names an Organisation predicate that must answer true for the tab to be
  # offered at all. It is data rather than an inline `if` in the renderer so a second
  # gated tab needs no new branch. The gate hides the ENTRANCE only; the matching
  # policy still has to refuse the actions (CodebaseImportFilePolicy#import_permitted?).
