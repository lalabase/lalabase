# Erases the personal records an account owns BEYOND the users row itself, for
# the account-erasure path: GDPR export archives, private meeting analyses,
# private ticket posts, personal tasks, linked people directory rows, the
# account's own chat threads (via
# PersonalChatErasure, which is included here so that both entry points get it
# through this ONE include) and, as access revocation, its personal access
# tokens.
#
# A concern rather than two methods, because the erasure has TWO entry points on
# the same table: User::DeletionLifecycle when a person deletes their own account,
# and Admin::User#soft_delete_and_anonymize! when an administrator does it from the
# backend. Those are separate implementations of the same promise (the separation
# is deliberate, see the header of user/deletion_lifecycle.rb), and a promise kept
# in only one of them is the failure mode this file exists to prevent. Found
# 2026-08-24: export archives and private analyses survived an admin erasure.
#
# ONE entry step, erase_personal_data! (private, called from inside each including
# class), and both paths call exactly that. A new kind of personal data is added
# here, once, and reaches both paths; a path that forgets the single call turns
# spec/models/user_erasure_path_parity_spec.rb red.
# spec/models/admin_twin_concern_parity_guard_spec.rb keeps the INCLUDE on both
# classes; it cannot see the call, which is why that second spec exists.
#
# Neither path ever runs a DELETE on users, both are soft deletes, so neither the
# FK (CASCADE on user_data_exports, NULLIFY on meeting_analyses) nor a
# `dependent:` option on an association would fire. Every step has to be explicit.

  # transaction commits. IO does not belong inside the transaction, and a purge
  # inside it would leave a purged archive behind a user who was never erased if a

  # AFTER commit — the same "row in the transaction, blob IO after commit"
  # property as the export archives above. Queried via
  # ActiveStorage::Attachment rather than the avatar association, so the step
  # reads the same on both classes (Admin::User deliberately has no avatar
  # association — see user.rb; the blobs live under record_type "User" either
  # way, which is also what routes the commit callback to ::User's
