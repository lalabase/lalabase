# Meeting (Gespräche) — a conversation/meeting as a first-class project work
# object: verbatim transcript + curated notes + a time/context anchor. Distinct
# from a knowledge Note (which is for finding); a Meeting is for working. See
# doc/gespraeche_plan.md.
#
# Slice 1a covers the CRUD foundation. Later slices added: participants (1b),
# time-session subject (2), ticket references (3), AI summary (4), participant
# detection (5). Slice 6 (this one) wires the embeddings/search opt-in:
# create_embeddings (opt-in per meeting, default false) now drives BOTH the
# knowledge full-text search AND chat embeddings, via has_many :fragments and
# Actors::SaveMeeting.
