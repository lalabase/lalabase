# The Notification model is the heart of the notification system.
#
# PURPOSE:
# A notification represents a message to a user about something
# important that happened (new comment, ticket assignment, etc.).
#
# WHY BUILT THIS WAY:
# - Can refer to anything (tickets, projects, documents) via polymorphic association
# - Automatically groups similar messages (5 comments = 1 notification)
# - Prevents duplicates via a unique fingerprint
# - Supports different channels (in-app, e-mail, webhook)
# - Tracks the complete lifecycle (queued → sent → delivered → read)
#
# EXAMPLE:
# "Tim assigned you ticket #123" → one notification
# "3 new comments on ticket #123" → one grouped notification

  # session groups) is measured against the whole project, a row without a
  # project (system messages) passes. Until 2026-10-07 the read side asked no

  # The PROJECT is not named here and not "whole project" either: it is the

  # object's title, number or address in the payload. Such a row has the area of
  # its EVENT (PROJECT_EVENT_TYPE below, Activities::AreaRegistry). Until
  # 2026-10-08 it counted as whole project, and every member, subscribed to the
  # project on joining, read the moved tickets' titles through the token inbox.
