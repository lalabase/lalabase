# Status and priority are NOT columns and NOT foreign keys — the ticket_statuses and
# ticket_priorities tables are gone. Both are strings inside the custom_attributes JSONB,
# with the allowed values configured per project in TicketAttributeDefinition. Whether a
# status counts as "done" is decided by the system functions attached to that option, so
# never compare status strings literally — use #done? or
