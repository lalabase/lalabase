# Encapsulates the complete display logic of the inbox master list:
# - Filters (state_filters, search, project, event_type)
# - Pagination (pagy)
# - Grouping by date (for the grouped view)
# - Empty-state logic
# - Active-filter detection
#
# Used both in Controller#index and in turbo_stream re-renders, so that the
# initial and live update take the exact same code path — date headers
# disappear automatically when the last item of a group is removed, the
# empty state appears as soon as nothing is left at all.
