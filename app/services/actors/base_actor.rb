# app/services/actors/base_actor.rb
#
# Base class for the "Actor" command-object pattern used for non-trivial writes
# (multi-step / own transaction / activity tracking / fanout / background job /
# external API / association sync). An actor encapsulates one write: it runs the
# transaction, maps validation/domain errors to a Result, sets Current.user for
# tracking, and schedules side-effect jobs after commit.
#
# Naming note: "Actor" here means a command object. It is unrelated to
# Activity#actor / Notification#actor, which denote the audit USER who caused a
# change. The collision is intentional but disjoint; do not conflate them.
#
# Two tiers share this class:
# - Tier 1 actors implement #perform (+ #record, + optional #enqueue_jobs) and
#   inherit the #call template below.
# - Tier 2 actors (SaveTicket, MoveTicket) override #call and only reuse the
#   shared helpers (with_error_mapping / with_actor_context / enqueue_after_commit
#   / success / failure / find_or_build), because their flow does not fit the
#   template. They MUST still wrap their body in #with_error_mapping so the
#   failure-mapping policy stays in one place (enforced by the contract guard).

module Actors
  # Raised inside an actor to signal a DOMAIN failure that must become a failed
  # Result (as opposed to an unexpected crash). Carries one or more messages and

  # the API maps it to an HTTP status) instead of sniffing the message strings.
