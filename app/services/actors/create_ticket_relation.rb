# app/services/actors/create_ticket_relation.rb
#
# Links two tickets of one organisation (doc/ticket_relations_plan.md, revision 4, §6.1).
# `kind` is one of the seven labels of TicketRelation::KINDS, read from `ticket`'s side. A
# backwards label (blocked_by, duplicated_by, follows) is stored flipped, so the other ticket
# becomes the source: one row per relation, whichever page it was set on.
#
# A waiting edge (TicketRelation::WAITING_TYPES) must not close a cycle. Two writers could each
# find none and together close one (A -> B and B -> A at the same time, or two edges that share
# no ticket and close a ring of four), so the lock is per organisation, and lock, cycle check
# and save! run in this actor's one transaction, in that order.
#
# No rights checks here. The caller makes sure the user may write tickets in the project of
# `ticket` and may read `other_ticket` (policy_scope(Ticket)); PR 2 does that in the controller.
# The ticket objects passed in do not learn about the new row (TicketRelation has no inverse on
# its belongs_to, on purpose): a caller that loaded ticket.outgoing_relations or
# incoming_relations before reads them fresh afterwards, or renders from a new query.
# No activity and no notification either (plan §6.2): TicketRelation is not Trackable, and
# neither ticket is written.
