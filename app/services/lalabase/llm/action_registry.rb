    # THE price list for AI actions, in ABSTRACT integer credits (decision 7A).
    #
    # The credit is deliberately decoupled from currency: an action costs whole
    # credits from this registry, currency only enters at pack-sale time (S7). This
    # is what makes "no call can cost 0 credits" structurally true — see #credits_for.
    #
    # Each action carries:
    #   :credits    — base price (flat actions) or price per started token block
    #   :per_tokens — nil for a flat action; N for a token-metered action
    #                 (credits = base * ceil(tokens / N), floored at 1 block)
    #
    # The i18n label lives under shared.ai.actions.<action> (DE + EN). A guard spec
    # (spec/services/lalabase/llm/action_registry_guard_spec.rb) pins that EVERY
    # action has a positive price AND both locale labels, so a new action can never
    # be deployed half-defined (failure mode "new action without price", plan §13).
    #
    # Start values are pauschale margins calibrated against the §3 cost frame; they
    # are documented in the PR body for confirmation and are trivially tunable here
    # (data, not schema).
