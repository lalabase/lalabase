# THE requirements side of the AI features — which lane, which pin, which metering
# action, which seam. Read by the UI gate (Organisation#ai_available_for?) AND by the
# routing (Lalabase::Llm::Factory.for_feature), so the two cannot drift apart.
# Entry point: fetch
module Lalabase
  module Llm
    # One entry per ROUTING DECISION (doc/ai_feature_registry_plan.md E2) — not per
    # call site, and not per ActionRegistry action: `summary` is booked by three
    # services with two different routing decisions, so an action-keyed table could
    # not answer for it. The criterion cuts in both directions, which is how you can
    # tell it is doing work: the three meetings services get three entries although
    # they share ONE inherited for_feature call site in BaseLlmService (their configuration is per subclass and
    # can diverge), while the assistant's surfaces share ONE entry (same job, one
    # decision) -- as the project chat did with it before projekt_chat_abbau.
    #
    # Why a registry at all: "may I offer this?" and "where does this go?" used to be
    # two independent derivations that agreed only by convention — and that
    # convention broke three times in one week (plan §1.2). Both questions now read
    # THIS table.
    #
    # The requirements are stated against what the FACTORY resolves for an org, never
    # against the org's provider columns (plan E7). That is what keeps this table
    # independent of the packages domain: when doc/ki_pakete_plan.md P2 changes how a
    # provider is resolved, it changes the innards of the resolution, and not one
    # line here.
    #
    # NOT a feature, deliberately: Factory.embedding_space_for. It resolves the
    # vector-space triple for a LOCAL DB read (no egress, no spend) and is therefore
    # gate-free on purpose (plan §7.5, Factory#embedding_space_for). UNGATED_RESOLUTIONS
