    # ticket's attachments use (ExtractPlainTextProcessingService.text_status).
    # ⚠️ Missing text is reported as missing, never explained: the stored columns
    # do not tell "not processed yet" from "processing failed", and an image-only
    # PDF stays without text however often it is processed.

    # so (text_truncated, text_length).
