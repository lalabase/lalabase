module Lalabase
  module Tools
    # Registry of LLM-callable tools, organised into named SETS — one registry,
    # two surfaces (D6), the assistant in two variants:
    #   :assistant    — the org-wide read tools of the personal thread (S3a T3).
    #   :assistant_with_code — the same, plus the five code tools, for an
    #                   organisation that has a connected repository at all.
    #   :mcp          — read + curated writes for the external MCP surface.
    #
    # The Runner consults `all_schemas(set:)` to advertise tools to the provider
    # and `by_name(name, set:)` to resolve a tool name back to its class. Both
    # default to :assistant.
    #
    # ⚠️ That default USED to be :project_chat, and projekt_chat_abbau moving it is
    # the sharp edge of this file: a caller that omits the argument silently changes
    # which tools it advertises. Every caller in the app names its set (the Runner
    # takes tool_set:, ChatResponseJob passes it), so the default only serves specs
    # and the console -- and it is pinned in registry_spec so it cannot drift back.
    #
    # HARD RULE (§6 / D6): only :mcp may contain mutating tools. Chat sets reach
    # the LLM tool loop, where ticket/post content is attacker-fillable — a write
    # tool there would be a prompt-injection write primitive. Enforced by
    # registry_spec's positive allowlist + no-mutating-tool guard.
    module Registry
      # Eager const references are intentional and Zeitwerk-safe: the autoloader
      # resolves load order at boot, so these classes are available whether
      # eager-loaded (production) or autoloaded (development).

      # Assistant (org-wide personal thread, S3a T3): the read tools with a REAL
      # org-wide branch — they resolve their rows through Context#scope (per-area
      # project reach / per-project ViewingScope) instead of a single project.
      # Deliberately NOT search_knowledge: the org thread has its own asker-gated
      # content retrieval (Retriever org path), so a second search surface would
      # only add injection surface and tokens.
      #
      # summarize_time_sessions (S2) is a REPORT tool: numbers, no rows. It decides
      # own-vs-all itself (TimeSessions::ViewingScope) because the :time_sessions
      # area gate cannot. Since MCP 0.12.0 it is in :mcp too, appended last there
      # (that wire order is pinned separately).
      #
      # recent_activity (§13-11) is here and ONLY here. Its rows span areas and
      # only the ticket ones can carry a citation, so a shared thread's render
      # gate could not redact the rest; the org thread is owner-only, which is
      # what makes it safe. Offering it on a SHARED surface would need per-area
      # citations first (see the tool's own comment).
      #
      # get_note and get_document (doc/assistent_wissen_kontext_plan.md, step 2)
      # and get_meeting (Bezugs-Sammlung S3) are what makes a knowledge or meeting
      # reference more than a label: the system prompt names a referenced object
      # by title and id only (Bezugs-Sammlung E5), and these three are the only
      # road from that id to the text.
      #
      # find_people and get_person (People S3) read the organisation's people directory. Like
      # the help tools they take no project and report no coverage, but they ask a right of
      # their own (the people right, inside the tool, before anything is read) and cite with
      # the people area, so an answer drawn on them stays with the asker. :mcp has twins of
      # them under the same names (McpFindPeople, McpGetPerson, People S3b), which name the
      # organisation and cite nothing.
      #
      # search_help, help_contents and get_help_page (doc/product_knowledge_plan.md, S2) read
      # Lalabase's OWN help, the one thing here that is not the organisation's. It is the same
      # for every organisation and has no rights of its own, so they take no project, report no
      # coverage and cite without an area. Not in :mcp: the plan leaves that surface out, and
      # its wire order is pinned.

      # of an answer through the same @tool_set symbol, so a flag would have to
      # travel with every caller, while a named set keeps the registry a lookup
