    # Sums the booked time of the scoped project by billing bucket, as JSON. The
    # first REPORT tool (doc/persoenlicher_assistent_plan.md, S2): it returns
    # numbers, never rows, so "how many hours are not invoiced yet" gets a counted
    # answer from the database instead of an estimate.
    #
    # Rights, and why this tool checks them itself (§6.4, §13-9): the area gate for
    # :time_sessions answers `can_view_own || can_view_all` and cannot tell a user
    # who may see only their own hours from one who may see everyone's. A sum over
    # ALL sessions handed to a can_view_own user would pass that gate. So the tool
    # narrows through TimeSessions::ViewingScope BEFORE it counts, reports the tier
    # (`scope`) so the model can say "your own hours", and refuses a user with no
    # persisted permission row. The area is still set on the citation (below); it
    # is what makes the answer content-bearing for the rights gate.
    #
    # Filters go through TimeSessionFilterService, the same object the time list
    # uses, so a number here is the number the same filters show in the UI. Dates
    # are validated HERE because that service swallows a malformed date silently,
    # which would return a project-wide sum wearing a period label.
