    # Version of the MCP SURFACE (the tool set + their schemas), independent of the
    # app version (D9). It evolves ADDITIVE-ONLY: adding a tool or an optional arg
    # bumps the minor; we never rename/remove a tool or break an existing arg, so a
    # pinned client keeps working. History: 0.1 = M1 read context, 0.2 = M2 ticket
    # reads, 0.3 = M3 curated writes (create_ticket/post_comment + idempotency),
    # 0.4 = search_knowledge (documentation link authoring, Slice 4), 0.5 =
    # list_notifications (inbox workflow S1, the first token-scoped tool), 0.6 =
    # create_time_session + mark_notification_read (inbox workflow S2/S3), 0.7 =
    # the machine field in `_meta` of every tool answer (terminal client S0 c,
    # see ToolCall#result_to_response); 0.7.1 = a ticket without read access
    # answers like a missing one instead of "Not authorized." (Base.
    # readable_tickets); 0.8 = list_notifications takes organisation_id (terminal
    # client S1 a); 0.9 = get_ticket pages comments and attachments, hands out
    # full text and one comment by post_id (S1 b/c); 0.10 = update_ticket: the
    # status, the assignees or the title of one ticket (terminal client S2), and
    # create_ticket takes the same title (one line, at most 255 characters,
    # anything else is invalid_input instead of being stored).
    # 0.11 = post_comment takes format: "plain" (terminal client S2b).
    # 0.12 = summarize_time_sessions (terminal client S6: the booked time of a
    # ticket). 0.13 = find_people and get_person (People S3b: the people directory,
    # for a token that reaches every project of the organisation named).
    # 0.13.1 = a key the store cannot hold (more than 255 bytes, no valid UTF-8,
    # a NUL) is refused as invalid_input before the write, as REST does since R0.
    # It narrows an existing argument on purpose, released as a fix: a key of 256
    # bytes up to about 2.6 KB used to be stored and replayed (one stored before
    # is refused now, not replayed), a longer one wrote again on every retry.

    # are curated, routed through the existing write seams, and gated by the
    # read_only PAT flag (D3). Kept as a
    # constant (not inlined) so specs can `stub_const('Mcp::Dispatcher::TOOLS', …)` and
