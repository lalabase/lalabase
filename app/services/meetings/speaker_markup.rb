# frozen_string_literal: true

# Bolds the speaker labels of a transcript at RENDER time, so "Samira: …" reads
# like the "**Samira:**" form the transcript tools sometimes emit and sometimes
# do not. Storage stays untouched: the edit textarea keeps showing what was pasted.
#
# The rule is deliberately NOT a generic "words + colon at line start" heuristic.
# That pattern matches ordinary prose — "Problem:", "Folge:", "Für die Kasse
# relevant:" (see spec/fixtures/meeting_transcripts/fixture_05_fallstricke.md) —
# and would bold half the notes. Instead the meeting's OWN participant list is the
# whitelist: a label is a speaker only if it normalizes onto a known participant.
# A speaker missing from that list stays unmarked (deliberate: the gap is a useful
# hint that a participant was not captured, and guessing brings the false positives
# straight back).
#
# THIRD site enforcing the speaker-line rule, after participant_parser.js
# (SPEAKER_LINE) and the prose rules in ParticipantDetectionService#system_prompt.
# They cannot be merged across the three runtimes; instead this mirrors the
# precedent of MeetingParticipant.normalize_name ↔ name_normalizer.js — mirrored
# implementations pinned to the SAME fixtures by spec.
