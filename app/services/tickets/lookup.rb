# The ticket search behind the "Link" modal (doc/ticket_relations_plan.md, revision 4, §7):
# up to LIMIT tickets of `scope` whose number is the term, then those whose title matches it.
#
# The caller hands in what the user may read (policy_scope(Ticket)); relations cross projects,
# so this search must never be run over anything wider. It searches number and TITLE only:
# Ticket.search_full_text also matches the text of every comment, private ones included, and a
# hit there would tell the searcher what a private comment says.
#
# No SQL is built from the term here. The number goes in as an integer, the title through
# pg_search (Ticket.search_title), which strips tsquery syntax and quotes the rest; the raw
# term in to_tsquery would raise on "foo:" or "(" while somebody is still typing.
