# What: a write that was authorized against a project takes the meeting's row
#   lock through Meeting#lock_in_project!, which answers whether the meeting is
#   still in that project. A bare lock on a meeting is refused outside the model.
# Why: Actors::MoveMeeting holds that lock while it moves a meeting. Three review
#   rounds of the move (lalabase/lalabase#45) found six writes that had been
#   authorized against the old project and still landed after a move: an edit,
#   a delete, a ticket link, a booking, an analysis publication, a second move.
#   Each had been fixed by hand with "lock, then compare the project". A rule
#   that has to be remembered at every write is not a rule.
#   The controllers lock through MeetingInProject#with_meeting_in_project, and
#   every write action of the meeting controllers is asked for it one by one:
#   a fourth round found create_summary unlocked in a file whose delete locked,
#   which a check per file had passed.
# Not seen: a write in a service or a controller this guard does not name.
#   WRITERS and CONTROLLERS pin the ones that exist; a new one is for the
#   person who reads the diff.
