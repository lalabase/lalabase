# Guard for #603: a DEACTIVATED membership yields no rows from any policy scope.
#
# The per-record path refuses such a member on its first line
# (ProjectPolicy#area_access? → active_member_of_record_organisation?). The list
# scopes went through AccessCheck::ProjectAccessService, which did not look at
# membership.active at all, so the same rule answered differently depending on
# which door you came through, and every caller that wanted it right enforced it
# by hand (ChatPolicy::Scope, Lalabase::Tools::Scope, Chats::OwnerBackfill).
# The rule now has ONE owner; this table is what holds it there.
#
# Every cell has BOTH halves. The active member must SEE the row first: without
# that flow anchor an empty result proves nothing, because a broken fixture is
# empty too.
