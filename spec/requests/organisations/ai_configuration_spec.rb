# frozen_string_literal: true

# What: Request spec for "Eigene Konfiguration" — the setup screen behind the
#   catalogue's own-configuration card (doc/ki_bereich_navigation_plan.md S7, E6-A).
# Type: Request spec — authorization, the per-provider form, and the three writes.
# Why (philosophy): The screen replaces a form that carried five of the plan's thirteen
#   gaps, and four of them are only observable at the request level: which FIELDS a
#   provider gets (L7), that "prüfen" runs after the save rather than before it (L5/E3),
#   that a save never removes a key while an explicit action does (L3/E2), and that the
#   verdict outlives the flash (L10). A "renders successfully" test would pass for a
#   screen with none of that.
# Contract: account_admin only; fields are rendered per provider and the ones that do
#   not apply are neither shown nor submitted; PATCH writes through the Actor and
#   optionally probes; DELETE is the only way a key leaves.
