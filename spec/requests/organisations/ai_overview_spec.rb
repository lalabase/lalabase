# What: Request spec for the AI area's hub (doc/ki_bereich_navigation_plan.md S2; the row
#   list of doc/ki_uebersicht_zeilenliste_plan.md).
# Type: Request spec — authorization + the three STATEMENTS the hub exists for.
# Why (philosophy): N1 decided the hub is not a dispatcher but an answer: "muss ich
#   etwas tun?" in three seconds, most visits ending here without a click. The page
#   answers in three places — one sentence about the switch, one main action for the
#   first open setup step, a dot on exactly the rows where something needs doing — and
#   those three are what this spec pins. A row whose dot never moves, or a lime button
#   that stays after its job is done, would satisfy a "renders successfully" test and
#   defeat the design.
# Contract: account_admin only; five rows; a dot only for attention (amber) or alert
#   (red), none while AI is off; one main action or none; with AI off the locked rows
#   render no link (§3.2, "zwei Gesichter"); every value ends on the same right edge.
