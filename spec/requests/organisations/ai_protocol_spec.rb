# What: Request spec for the AI area's protocol page
#   (doc/ki_bereich_navigation_plan.md S5, L13/E5).
# Type: Request spec — authorization, tenant separation, the selection of rows and the
#   ceiling that keeps the page from growing with the organisation's age.
# Why (philosophy): The value of this page is completeness and correctness of ATTRIBUTION,
#   not that it renders. A page that shows three of four verbs, or one that shows a
#   neighbour's trail, looks exactly as healthy as a correct one — there is no error, no
#   blank, nothing a screenshot would reveal. So the examples below are about WHICH rows
#   appear and WHOSE, and every one of them is written so it fails if that selection
#   slips.
# Contract: account_admin only; the four protocol verbs and nothing else; rows of the
#   CURRENT tenant only; newest first; at most PAGE_SIZE rows per page and never more
#   than MAX_PAGE_SIZE however the request asks.
