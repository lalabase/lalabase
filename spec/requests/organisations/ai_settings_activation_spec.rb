# What: Request spec for the GDPR org-level AI opt-in (audit 2026-07-03, 1.2).
# Type: Request spec — authorization + activation bookkeeping.
# Why (philosophy): The opt-in is the LEGAL basis documentation for every AI
#   transfer: activation must be admin-only and must record who activated when.
#   Deactivation keeps that history (audit trail); re-activation overwrites it
#   so the record always documents the LATEST activation. Non-admin members
#   must not be able to flip the switch (app convention: Pundit denial →
#   redirect with not_authorized flash, never a silent success).
# Contract: POST activate/deactivate on /org/:id/ai_settings is account_admin
#   only; activate stamps ai_activated_at + ai_activated_by, deactivate only
#   clears ai_enabled.
