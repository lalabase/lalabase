# frozen_string_literal: true

# What: GET /ai_settings/confirm_package — the KI-Pakete P4b consequence dialog
#   that now stands between a package card and a lane-moving switch.
# Type: Request spec.
# Why (philosophy): P4a made the switch customer-triggerable and metered while
#   the cards stayed shut; §9 named the one thing that had to exist before they
#   could open — a quota pre-check, because the gate fires ONCE at the provider
#   build and a run that starts inside the budget keeps going until the corpus is
#   done, taking chat AND semantic search down with it for the rest of the month.
#   These examples therefore assert the dialog's STATEMENTS, not its markup: what
#   changes legally, what it costs, whether the quota covers it, and what search
#   does meanwhile. A dialog that renders but omits one of those is the failure
#   mode this slice exists to prevent.
# Contract: the dialog appears only for a switch that actually moves the vector
#   space; it names both jurisdictions and the direction of the change; it quotes
#   an estimate and holds it against the remaining quota; and the only write it
#   offers is the same #select_package POST the card used to fire directly.
