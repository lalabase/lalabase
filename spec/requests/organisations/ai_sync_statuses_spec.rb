# What: Request spec for the AI area's "Indexierung" page
#   (doc/ki_bereich_navigation_plan.md §3.5, slice S4).
# Type: Request spec — the SUMMARY states, plus the authorization around them.
# Why (philosophy): Before S4 this page was raw statistics: eight counters from which
#   the admin had to work out for themselves whether anything was broken. §3.5 turns the
#   top of the page into a statement in words plus the one action that helps, so what
#   has to be pinned is the STATEMENT, not that the page renders. A summary that reads
#   the same in all four situations would satisfy a "returns 200" test and be worth
#   nothing — which is why every example below asserts a state that differs from the
#   others.
# Contract: account_admin only; the summary reports clear / outstanding / failed from
#   Embeddings::IndexHealth (the hub's source, never a second count), states a running
#   staged switch as the REASON alongside the backlog rather than instead of it, names
#   the vector space the counts describe, and offers the reprocess action exactly when
#   there is something to catch up.
