# What: Request spec for "Verbrauch", the AI area's consumption page
#   (doc/ki_bereich_navigation_plan.md S6, gap L8).
# Type: Request spec — authorization, the numbers, and the MOVE itself.
# Why (philosophy): the quota bar, the six-month Nachweis-Historie and the 30-day token
#   statistic used to share the settings page with the package catalogue and the provider
#   form, which is why the hub's "Verbrauch" card linked to the same URL as its "Zugang"
#   card. The examples below therefore assert on both ends of the move: the new page shows
#   the real values, and the old page no longer does. A spec that only checked the new
#   page would stay green if the content had merely been COPIED.
#   The consumption examples (bar, 80% warning, Kulanz, exhausted banner) come verbatim
#   from spec/requests/organisations/ai_settings_quota_spec.rb (S3 KI-Kontingent UI,
#   test 25) — moved with their subject rather than deleted.
# Contract: account_admin only; credits before tokens; ONE QuotaLedger per request.
