# What: Lalabase::Tools::SummarizeTimeSessions — sums the project's booked time by
#       billing bucket (billed / in_billing / without_billing) for the project chat.
# Type: Service spec.
# Why:  This is the first report tool (Plan doc/persoenlicher_assistent_plan.md,
#       S2). Two things decide whether it is safe, and both are the load-bearing
#       cases below: (1) the area gate for :time_sessions cannot tell "own" from
#       "all" (§2.4), so the tool must narrow to the asker's own sessions ITSELF
#       when the asker may only view their own (§6.4, §13-9); (2) an answer built
#       only on tool data with no area-bearing citation counts as content-free
#       and reaches every reader ungated (§2.3, PR #534), so every number must be
#       cited with area 'time_sessions'.
