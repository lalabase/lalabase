# Structural guards for the GDPR export registry (doc/user_data_export_plan.md).
#
# Guard 1 — secrets: the export must NEVER emit credential material. Whitelists
# are declared in UserDataExports::Registry; this spec breaks the build if any
# declared key looks like a secret, so "someone adds a column later and it
# leaks into the ZIP" is structurally impossible.
#
# Guard 2 — completeness: the export must not drift into silent incompleteness.
# Every table that references a user (real FK to users OR a user-ish column
# name — FK constraints are NOT reliable here, e.g. posts.user_id has none)
# must be classified: either a Registry source or an EXCLUDED entry with a
# reason. A new user-data table breaks the build until it is classified.
# Works on DB introspection (connection.foreign_keys/columns), NOT on parsing
# schema.rb text — dump formatting changes cannot break it.
# Secret shapes that must never appear as exported keys.
