# ⚠️ Selenium Manager cannot run on an ARM dev machine.
#
# selenium-webdriver ships exactly ONE Linux binary and it is x86-64
# (bin/linux/selenium-manager); for macOS it ships a universal binary. That is
# the whole reason the same suite runs on the Mac and dies in the Parallels VM.
# On aarch64 the kernel rejects the binary with ENOEXEC, the POSIX fallback
# hands the file to /bin/sh, and the ELF bytes come back as
# `1: Syntax error: "(" unexpected` -- a message that says nothing about
# architecture and sends people looking for a broken shell script.
#
# Naming the driver ourselves skips the manager entirely: DriverFinder reads
# `service.class.driver_path` first and only calls Selenium Manager when that is
# nil (selenium-webdriver driver_finder.rb:47).
#
# This module is the ONE owner of those paths. rails_helper.rb used to repeat
# the decision inside a register_driver block, hardcoded to
# /usr/bin/chromedriver -- which is precisely the spelling several Chromium
# packages do not use, so the fallback into the manager happened anyway.

  # the touch page in CI, and four examples of spec/system/inbox_spec.rb were

# One Chrome per driver lives for the whole run, and a resize outlives the

# and column_picker_spec then measured a table whose columns were still easing,
# session_timeout_spec left 1440 x 900 and ticket_waiting_list_spec lost the
# column it looks for, which only fits beside the lane at 1920. Each of them was
# green alone and red in the full run, in the same order every time.
